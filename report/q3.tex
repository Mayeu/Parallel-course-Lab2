\chapter{Thread management}

If the thread are joinable the main program will wait in the \verb+pthread_join+ function that all the thread finish their work:

\verbatiminput{file/q3.1}

Now if we set the thread as detachable thread, we see that main finish his work, and wait for the thread just before exiting:

\verbatiminput{file/q3.2}

Finally, by removing \verb+pthread_exit+ from the main we see that the program exit without waiting for the thread:

\verbatiminput{file/q3.3}
