\chapter{Thread Management}

If the threads are joinable the main program will wait in the \verb+pthread_join+ function that all the threads finish their work:

\verbatiminput{file/q3.1}

Now if we set the threads as detachable, we see that main finishes his work, and waits for the threads just before exiting:

\verbatiminput{file/q3.2}

Finally, by removing \verb+pthread_exit+ from the main, we see that the program exits without waiting for the threads:

\verbatiminput{file/q3.3}
