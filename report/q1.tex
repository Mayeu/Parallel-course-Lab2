\chapter{Compile and run Pthreads programs}

As expected, running the hello program results in several \textit{Hello World!} being printed, one for each processor we are running on.

After modification of the program, we have the following result:

\verbatiminput{file/q1.1}

We can see that there is no pre-defined order between the threads because the order of the messages changes. This is due to the thread scheduler. So, there is no way to tell which one will start first or in which order the result will appear.

The second program use a struct to pass more argument to the thread. After the modification we got the following output:

\verbatiminput{file/q1.2}
